### 5. Configure Secrets

**For Local Development:**

2. Edit `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and add your actual Discord bot token
3. The Guild ID is already set to: `1393935478503243917`

**For Streamlit Cloud Deployment:**
1. Go to your app settings in Streamlit Cloud
2. Navigate to "Secrets" section  
3. Add these secrets:
   ```toml
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN = "your_actual_token"
   DISCORD_GUILD_ID = "1393935478503243917"
   ```

### 6. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

   - Monitor the progress bar and status updates
   - Review results when complete

4. **Download Results**:
   - Click "Download Results" to get a CSV report
   - Contains timestamps, usernames, and success/failure status

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Security Considerations
- **Keep your bot token secure** - never share it publicly
- **Test with a small group first** before bulk operations
- **Backup your member list** before performing bulk removals
- **Verify permissions** - ensure bot has necessary permissions

### Rate Limiting
- The tool includes built-in delays to respect Discord's rate limits
- Large operations may take time to complete safely
- Monitor the logs for any rate limit warnings

### Error Handling
- Users not found in the server will be logged as failed
- Permission errors are captured and reported
- All operations are logged to `discord_bot.log`

## üìù Logs and Troubleshooting

### Log Files
- `discord_bot.log` - Contains all bot operations and errors
- Results can be downloaded as CSV from the interface

### Common Issues

1. **Bot not connecting**:
   - Verify bot token is correct
   - Check if bot is invited to the server
   - Ensure bot has necessary permissions

2. **Users not found**:
   - Verify usernames are spelled correctly
   - Check if users are still in the server
   - Ensure usernames don't include discriminators (#1234)

3. **Permission errors**:
   - Verify bot has Kick Members/Ban Members permissions
   - Check if bot's role is higher than target users
   - Ensure bot has Server Members Intent enabled

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Connection testing** before executing actions
- **Progress tracking** with ability to stop mid-process
- **Detailed logging** of all operations
- **Error reporting** for failed operations
- **Backup recommendations** in documentation
